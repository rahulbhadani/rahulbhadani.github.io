  abstract = {Distributed in-memory storage systems are crucial for
                  meeting the low latency requirements of modern
                  datacenter services. However, they lose all state on
                  failure, so recovery is expensive and data loss is
                  always a risk. Persistent memory (PM) offers the
                  possibility of building fast, persistent in-memory
                  storage; however, existing PM systems are built from
                  scratch or require heavy modification of existing
                  systems. To rectify these problems, this paper
                  presents Persimmon, a PM-based system that converts
                  existing distributed in-memory storage systems into
                  persistent, crash-consistent versions with low
                  overhead and minimal code changes.},
